    With the height of holidays and large gatherings from December 2020 to January 2021, COVID-19 cases have been rampant across New York State. Seven months into 2021, however, we can see that the cases are somewhat declining.

According to the first chart below with statistics provided by the official New York State data site, we can see that in January, COVID-19 cases were the highest it's been since the year started with 428.5k cases. According to CNN reporter Eric Levenson, the high cases are due to New York being the most visited destination in the U.S., especially during the holiday season. However, as we get to February, we see a large decline in cases. From January to February COVID-19 cases declined by 211,000 cases. As we continue throughout the months, there is a steady decline in cases leading to the summer. </center>

As cases are declining, 2021 still holds the highest case count so far in comparison to 2020. In the chart below we can see that there is a 133,075 case number difference between 2020 and 2021. According to journalists Nate Hanson and Mauricio Chamberlin, COVID-19 cases are higher this year in comparison to 2020 because of the more contagious delta variant being rampant currently. 

As more people are getting vaccinated and wearing masks, COVID-19 cases are the second lowest its been in New York States since the year started, with 16.5k cases.
