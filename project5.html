                <span class="hugeLetter">S</span>ince the very start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. has gone through an immense amount of change. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, restaurant and food services have suffered the most during and after the pandemic, with high levels of job losses and inflation within the industry. Unfortunately, this also means that everyone’s beloved $1 NYC pizza slice is now discontinued. According to researchers it appears that inflation isn’t the only thing to blame for the rising of pizza prices.

            <p class="paragraph">Liam Quigley, an NYC-based reporter created a data set in which he logged every slice of pizza he ate in NYC from 2014-2022. In the data set, he logged 464 slices of pizza. In the table, Quigley displays the rise of pizza prices as the years go by. Through this table, he has a link to each Instagram post where he has an image of each pizza slice, the name of each restaurant, the location (longitude and latitude) of each restaurant, the date of each visit, the price of each slice, and the style of pizza (which is either plain or pepperoni). A pepperoni slice purchased at a whopping $6.53 at Artichoke Basille’s Pizza’s Time Square location was Quigley’s most expensive slice. In Quigley’s own explanation of his research, he mentions that he has noticed a decline in certain ingredients.

                <aside class="pquote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>"The biggest thing I have noticed is the decline in the amount of sauce put on slices. I’m sure this is a cost-saving measure, but the overall quality of your average slice in the city has definitely suffered," Quigley said.</p>

                     Inflation is the general reason for the prices of pizzas going up. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 2020-2023 the pricing for basic pizza ingredients are getting more expensive as displayed in the following charts. It is apparent that there is a steady increase in the price of cheese, flour, and tomatoes, and even pepperoni. 


                     <p class="paragraph">According to the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the price of cheese in the U.S. is at an all time high in 2023 with costs at $4.72 per pound. From the chart below, there is a steady incline of the price since 2020.

            <p class="paragraph">
            For tomatoes, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the price of tomatoes was at its all time high in 2020 with  costs at $1.96 per pound.

<p class="paragraph">
Flour costs are also at an all time high in 2023 with the price being $0.54 per pound, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

<p class="paragraph">
The price of pork has also increased steadily. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, pork costs are its highest in 2022 at $4.89 per pound.

<div style="min-height:193px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vR6kx/embed.js?v=1" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vR6kx/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<p class="paragraph">
For the most part, all of these cost increases have the pandemic in common. For cheese, the price will continue to increase as the heightened costs for dairy farmers increase. Since the pandemic officially ceasing as a public emergency, restaurants have fully opened and are now all on a quest for dairy products. With dairy products being in higher demand, the cost of production on these farms will increase, thus resulting in a higher cost for consumers and a delay in supply. The increase in cost of pork also falls into the same attributes of cheese. Pandemic-induced fuel costs make it challenging to transport pork to consumers. 

<p class="paragraph">
    For tomato production, according to a study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the COVID-19 lockdown led to tomato supply issues, however the demand stayed the same. With the demand staying the same, the prices increased for local and wholesale retailers. 


  <p class="paragraph">  
Due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, flour prices have increased immensely as well. Russia has also recently withdrew from the Grain Deal agreement, which is not only affecting the price of flour in the United States, but the rest of the world as well.

<p class="paragraph">  
According to an article published by CBS 6 Albany, pizza restaurant owner Guy Sementilli explained that prices for ingredients are at levels he’s never seen in his life. 

                <aside class="pquote">
    <blockquote>
        <p> “Yeah, on a whole global level there’s definitely a concern of those flour prices, where prices, they’re gonna go up more than the $22-$23 for a 50-pound bag. So it's just very, very concerning where we’re going with these increasing prices.” - Guy Sementilli</p>

<p class="paragraph">  
The constant increase of the pizza prices can definitely be attributed to several different things. Supply chain, COVID-19, and the Ukraine war have all increased the prices of foods. The restaurant industry will have to adapt to these increases, however, for now pizza enthusiasts must decide if their cravings are worth the new cost.
